# linux-project-1
This repo is intended to be able to set up the pi zero for my project from the
moment after user initialization in the event of an OS corruption or something
of the sort.

Wifi should be set up and git installed before running this script. Download it like the below.
``` shell
git clone https://github.com/vim-is-life/linux-project-1.git
```

And then run the script like the below
``` shell
./setup.sh
```

# Configuration
Files in the `ssh` and `nginx` are for the system and will be moved by the script to the appropriate directories.
